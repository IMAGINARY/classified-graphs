<h4>Graphs</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Graphs </strong> (or networks) are geometric objects consisting of
  vertices (also called nodes) and edges (also called links).
</p>

<p>
  Graphs are used to study connections and relationships between entities
  represented by vertices in the graph. Therefore, the only relevant information
  is how many vertices are there, and how are those connected by edges. The
  position of the vertices in the screen or the length of the edges are not
  important (those are irrelevant features of the graph), you can drag and
  reposition the vertices anywhere on the window and it is still considered the
  same graph. Technically, we say that the original and the repositioned graphs
  are <strong>isomorphic</strong>.

<p class="action-tip">
  In the left panel, you have a list of different graphs. You can select any
  graph of the list or create your own by adding/removing vertices and edges.
</p>

<h4>Classifications in mathematics</h4>
<p>
  In mathematics as in other sciences, when we find many objects of the same
  family, we try to classify them by certain properties, so objects in different
  classes can be distinguished easily. Those properties are called
  <strong>invariants</strong>, because they do not change when only the
  irrelevant features change.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, the number of vertices or the number of edges are invariants of
  a graph, because they do not change when repositioning the vertices. But "the
  length of the longest edge" or "forming an equilateral triangle with some of
  its edges" are not invariant properties and cannot be used to classify graphs.
</p>

<p class="action-tip">
  You can select in the menu several invariants to be displayed. You can click
  on the name of the invariant to obtain its definition.
</p>

<h4>Using invariants to identify a graph</h4>

<p>
  To distinguish between graphs, we can use one or more invariants. If two
  graphs are considered the same (are isomorphic), then all their invariants
  will be exactly the same for both of them. Therefore, if we compute a certain
  invariant and it is not the same for both graphs, we can deduce that the
  graphs are not isomorphic. However, it is not enough to verify that one or
  more invariants are the same to conclude that the two graphs are isomorphic
  (for instance, there are many non-isomorphic graphs with the same number of
  vertices).
</p>

<p>
  We can say informally that a graph invariant is more powerful than another if
  it allows to distinguish more non-isomorphic graphs. The "perfect" invariant
  (called a complete invariant) would be one such that there is only one graph
  per each value of the invariant, and thus it allows to distinguish any two
  graphs. Unfortunately, there is not any known practical invariant that can
  distinguish any two graphs*.
</p>

<div class="action-tip">
  <p>
    You can try to identify some graphs with the option "Which graph is this?",
    that will open a window with your target graph. That is one of the graphs of
    the left hand side list. Select one graph from the list and click on "Check"
    to verify. Of course you can do it by eye inspection, maybe helping yourself
    by repositioning some vertices, but you can take advantage of the
    invariants. You can filter the graph list to show only those with a certain
    value of the invariants.

    Try to solve all the proposed challenges, or the always changing "random"
    challenge.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="footnote">
  * Since there is a countable number of graphs, it is theoretically possible to
  assign arbitrarily a natural number to each graph, which would be a complete
  invariant. The problem with this approach is that we need to create and store
  such an infinite list of graphs, and to "compute" that invariant we would need
  to look up in the list which is our target graph, but that is exactly the
  problem we try to solve with such an invariant.
