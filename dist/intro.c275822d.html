<h5>Intro</h5><p> Graphs (or networks) are geometric objects consisting of vertices (also called nodes) and edges (also called links). </p><p> In the left panel, you have a list of different graphs. You can select any graph of the list or create your own by adding/removing vertices and edges. </p><p> Graphs are used to study networks, so the relevant information is how many nodes are there, and how are those connected by edges. The position of the vertices in the screen or the length of the edges are not important (those are irrelevant features of the graph), you can drag and reposition the vertices anywhere on the window and it is still considered the same graph. Technically, we say that the original and the repositioned graphs are isomorphic. </p>Classifications in mathematics<p> When mathematicians find many objects of the same family, they try to classify them by certain properties, so objects in different classes can be distinguished easily. Those properties are called invariants, because they do not change when the irrelevant features change. </p><p> For instance, the number of vertices or the number of edges are invariants of a graph, because they do not change when repositioning the vertices. But "the length of the longest edge" or "forming an equilateral triangle with some of its edges" are not invariant properties and cannot be used to classify graphs. </p><p> You can select in the menu several invariants to be displayed. You can click on the name of the invariant to obtain its definition. </p><p> To distinguish between graphs, we can use one or more invariants. If two graphs are considered the same (are isomorphic), then all their invariants will be exactly the same for both of them. Therefore, if we compute a certain invariant and it is not the same for both graphs, we can deduce that the graphs are not isomorphic. However, it is not enough to verify that one or more invariants are the same to conclude that the two graphs are isomorphic (for instance, there are many non-isomorphic graphs with the same number of vertices). </p><p> We can say informally that a graph invariant is more powerful than another if it allows to distinguish more non-isomorphic graphs. The "perfect" invariant (called a complete invariant) would be one such that there is only one graph per each value of the invariant, and thus it allows to distinguish any two graphs. Unfortunately, there is not any known practical invariant that can distinguish any two graphs*. </p><p> You can try to identify some graphs with the option "Which graph is this?", that will open a window with your target graph. That is one of the graphs of the left hand side list. Select one graph from the list and click on "Check" to verify. Of course you can do it by eye inspection, maybe helping yourself by repositioning some vertices, but you can take advantage of the invariants. You can filter the graph list to show only those with a certain value of the invariants. </p><p> Try to solve all the proposed challenges, or the always changing "random" challenge. </p><p> *footnote: since there is a countable number of graphs, it is theoretically possible to assign arbitrarily a natural number to each graph, which would be a complete invariant. The problem with this approach is that we need to have such an infinite list of graphs and we need to identify which one of the list is our target graph, which is exactly the problem we try to solve with an invariant. </p>
